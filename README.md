### OrionSort — Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (C++ / SDL3 / ImGui)
A cross-platform sorting algorithm visualizer that animates multiple algorithms with flexible visual modes and optional audio feedback.

**Highlights**
- Multiple algorithms (Bubble, Quick, Merge, Radix LSD, and more)
- Multiple visual styles (bars, dots, circles, spirals)
- Adjustable array length and speed controls
- CMake-based cross-platform builds
- Debug window for tracking variables and internal metrics

Repo: https://github.com/TheUltimateOrion/OrionSort

### BFC-Compiler — Brainfuck Compiler (C, single-file, no deps)
A blazingly fast Brainfuck compiler written in C with a clean, clang-inspired CLI.  
Designed to be minimal, portable, and fully self-contained.

**Highlights**
- Zero external dependencies (standard library only)
- One-file implementation philosophy
- Brainfuck-specific optimizations (instruction coalescing, peepholes, clear-loop recognition)
- Intended pipeline: compile to optimized assembly, then assemble/link to an executable

## Robotics (FRC)
In high school, I served as Programming Head for FIRST Robotics Competition Team 3560, leading coding work for the 2025 Reefscape season robot.

- Worked on robot control code and mechanisms (motors, servos, power distribution, etc.)
- Built experience in teamwork, iteration under deadlines, and applied engineering

## What I Care About
- Performance and correctness first
- Minimal dependencies and clean builds
- Tooling that feels good to use
- Projects that teach me something real (and ideally ship)

If you want to collaborate on a project or discuss an idea, feel free to connect with me.
