### <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/2699_fe0f/512.gif" alt="⚙" width="32" height="32"> BFC-Compiler — Brainfuck Compiler (C, single-file, no deps)
A blazingly fast Brainfuck compiler written in C with a clean, clang-inspired CLI.  
Designed to be minimal, portable, and fully self-contained.

**Highlights**
- Zero external dependencies (standard library only)
- One-file implementation philosophy
- Brainfuck-specific optimizations (instruction coalescing, peepholes, clear-loop recognition)
- Intended pipeline: compile to optimized assembly, then assemble/link to an executable

## <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f389/512.gif" alt="🎉" width="32" height="32"> What I Care About
- Performance and correctness first
- Minimal dependencies and clean builds
- Tooling that feels good to use
- Projects that teach me something real (and ideally ship)

If you want to collaborate on a project or discuss an idea, feel free to connect with me.
